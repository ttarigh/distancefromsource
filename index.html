      <h2>
        This is a body of text that I'm writing. I'm writing this body of text.
        This is precious information. I think the information is precious. I
        think it's precious because it is today's diary entry. Life is about
        beautiful things and beautiful people. If you think the world looks
        good, guess what: It does. It's not anybody's fault that love is the
        only thought and pain is the only feeling. If you ask me, that doesn't
        sound like such a bad situation. Existence is innocent, pl–µase don't try
        to think otherwise. At this point, I feel like I'm almost one hundred
        percent pure angel. People need to stop trying to be cool and they need
        to start trying to be hot. Because, remember, the enemy is yourself
        posed as a question. I'm not exactly sure how to write about love or
        life in a way better than that song. I'm not sure what kinda of
        vulnerable text I could write in here that would make this website worth
        visiting for you. I want to make it worth visiting to you. Do you miss
        me? Do you love me? Did I love you? Is love realy the only thought. I
        can apply it to pretty much every instance of any action I've ever taken
        or not taken, especially if you count the absence of thinking about love
        as technically thinking about love. I saw something like if you walk
        into a room and something isn't there, but that's all you can think
        about, then it kinda is there. I hate seeing myself one way and having
        other people see me another way. Although, most times I believe this is
        to my benefit. I try to confess as much as possible, even though I heard
        that's pretty much the opposite of what you're supposed to do. The
        compulsion feels too good to let go of, the freedom of living without
        secret, without burden, without anything really... I appreciate it. I
        think I'm one of the few people that wants to know the future exactly.
        Because I don't think it would change anything for me. I think very few
        things would change my given circumstances (emotionally). Everyday I
        wake up and want to be better, I want to make art, I want to spread
        love, I want to eat a really good sandwich. I want to meet everyone in
        the world. The superpower I would choose to have if I could have any
        would be to possess the ability to communicate with any creature. I have
        the opportunity to learn a new language for free at the UN, and I don't
        know which langauge to pick. I don't know what door of the universe to
        open up for myself and my loved ones. I guess if I had infinite money,
        I'd just fund bigger projects for myself, buy a big house for all my
        friends, and spend all day learning languages.
